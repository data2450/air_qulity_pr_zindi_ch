Air pollution is the world’s largest environmental health risk, contributing to 7 million premature deaths globally each year, and poor people in developing countries are the most heavily affected. Low-cost IoT sensor networks on the ground have the potential to close the climate data gaps in sub-Saharan Africa, but networks are expensive to implement and maintain in African cities.

Satellite-derived PM2.5 estimates based on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and machine learning techniques can be used to estimate pollution levels over large areas to help develop interventions such as vulnerability risk profiles for urban spaces, health preservation and environmental protection for affected populations, as well as community empowerment, and climate change mitigation.

In this challenge, you are asked to estimate PM2.5 levels from satellite observations based on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) for eight cities in seven African countries - Lagos, Accra, Nairobi, Yaounde, Bujumbura, Kisumu, Kampala, and Gulu - with varying ground monitoring resolutions, using appropriate machine learning algorithms. Ground-based observations in the selected cities will be used to validate the satellite estimates.

The models you create will be deployed through AirQo’s user-friendly digital platform (http://platform.airqo.net), which empower communities to access crucial air quality information, providing them with the evidence needed to tackle local pollution challenges, improve public health, and achieve environmental justice.

This objective of the project is to estimate PM2.5 levels from satellite observations based on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) for eight cities in seven African countries i.e., Kampala, Lagos, Accra, Nairobi, Yaounde, Bujumbura, Kisumu, and Gulu. PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter that has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers and is one of the most harmful air pollutants. PM2.5 is a common measure of air quality that normally requires ground-based sensors to measure.

Train set contains the cities, Kampala, Lagos, Nairobi and Bujumbura. The test contains the cities Kisumu, Gulu, Accra and Yaoundé.
